# Tree Cycle App & Rootstock Token

### App & Token Summary
<p>The App called Tree Cycle will be an interface that allows users to mine a Token called Rootstock Token that can be mined by the physical action of planting a tree and geo-locating the tree. The token is split into 12 parts while it is initially being mined one photo per month thus planting will be the mining process for the Rootstock token. Reaching 12/12 parts of the Rootstock then allows for the Token to be Available to the Tree Planter if the tree is proven alive in all 12 photos by consensus (6) votes per photo (voters do not include photographer or planter). Once 12/12 photos are confirmed for life and mapped the Token fragments will then transform into one whole Rootstock Token.  Using another Analysis software the App will be able to connect the Tokens to The Type of Tree it is and Calculate the Trees Ecological Cost and Benefits over the average lifetime of that Tree Species. This Value Calculation will determine the individual "Value Growth Potential" of the Rootstock Token.</p>

 <p>Those who are receiving or purchase Rootstock tokens from the planter will have all or a percentatge of the originally mined Rootstock Token with pictures of the Tree and Geo-Location of the Tree planted. The Original Rootstock Token that was mined if/when the token or a percentage leaves the Wallet of the "Rootstock Token Planter Miner" leaves behind an Duplicate Rootstock Token "Living Wood Token" a tracking Token. This Living Wood Token is a system that takes checks for proof of life of the tree as it grows on a 12-month basis the tree will be photographed and measured. Approximate size analysis will assist Growth Rate Projections for the "Value Growth Potential."</p> 

<p> If the Tree is Cut Down or Dies the Connected Rootstock Token and Living Wood Token become "Wood Shavings" this token could have Values Based on the trees species, size at death and choice of use post harvest. If the Tree is left where it fell the Carbon Sequestration is potentially increasing the amount of Wood Shavings. If the tree was harvested for structural lumber this could potentially increse the amount of Wood Shavings of the for use because of carbon sequestration in buildings.</p>

<p>Token type called "Wood Shavings" users can earn a percent Wood Shavings from verifying signs of life in Tree Pictures submitted by themselves or other Users. Users also earn Wood Shavings each 12 months based on the Trees Carbon Sequestration calculations for that 12 month period.  Wood Shavings will be mined by the process of verifying tree life and by the continuous 12 month confirmation of existence of the connected tree its value will be related to the Rootstock Token Value as a fraction of the Rootstocks "Potential Growth Value".</p>

### Purpose
<p>The main Purpose of this token is to incentivize the regenerative act of planting a tree by providing a potential market beyond just planting a tree and waiting to get a harvest be it material or food. Being linked to the Blockchain allows the tokens to have a verifyable Tradeable Value for other currencies as well as a roadmap for tracking transaction history. These Tokens will provide reasons to not harm a forest because of its value as a carbon sink. People will also be able to tie the value of the token to the Value of Carbon sequestration thus creating a whole new market in speculation.</p>

**Environmental Benefits**: Trees contribute to air purification by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, mitigating climate change, reducing air pollution, and providing habitat for wildlife.
**Economic Benefits**: Trees can increase property values, reduce energy costs by providing shade and windbreaks, and contribute to water conservation by reducing runoff and erosion.
**Social Benefits**: Trees enhance the aesthetic beauty of an area, provide recreational opportunities, and contribute to overall well-being by creating pleasant environments for people to live, work, and play.
**Health Benefits**: Trees have been shown to improve mental health by reducing stress and anxiety, as well as physical health by providing opportunities for outdoor exercise and reducing the risk of heat-related illnesses through shade.
(Positive Long Term)
**Long-Term Value**: Consider the long-term impact of a tree's growth on the environment and community. A mature tree can provide significantly more benefits than a young sapling, so it's important to consider the value it will provide over its lifetime.
(Positive Long Term)
**Cost of Maintenance**: While trees offer numerous benefits, they also require maintenance such as pruning, watering, and protection from pests and diseases. Factoring in the cost of maintenance helps to determine the overall value of planting and caring for a tree.(negative)
**Community Engagement**: Planting trees can foster community engagement and pride, as well as encourage environmental stewardship among residents.
Future Considerations: Assessing the potential future impacts of climate change, urban development, and other factors on the tree's growth and viability can help determine its long-term value.

By considering these factors comprehensively, we can determine the holistic value of planting a tree beyond just its monetary worth.    

**Data Collection**: First, you'll need to collect the relevant tree and environmental data. This could include factors like tree species, age, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), environmental conditions (e.g., soil type, climate), and any other variables that might influence the value of your tokens.
**Data Processing**: Once you have the data, you'll need to process it to extract meaningful insights. This could involve cleaning the data, performing calculations, and preparing it for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Next, you'll apply statistical techniques and methods to analyze the data and compute the desired value for your tokens. This could include:
**Descriptive statistics**: Calculating measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., to summarize the data.
**Regression analysis**: Examining the relationships between variables and predicting values based on observed data.
**Hypothesis testing**: Testing hypotheses about the relationships between variables or the significance of differences between groups.
**Spatial analysis**: Analyzing spatial patterns and relationships in the data, especially relevant for environmental data.
**Machine learning**: Using algorithms to discover patterns and make predictions based on the data.
**Integration with Tree Cycle App**: Once you've coded the statistical analysis processes, you can integrate them into your app. Depending on your app's architecture, we might implement the analysis logic on the server-side and expose it through an API.
**User Interface**: Finally, you'll need to design a user interface in your app to present the results of the statistical analysis to users in a clear and understandable way. This could involve visualizations like charts, graphs, maps, or simple textual summaries.
Overall, coding statistical analysis processes for your app is definitely achievable, especially with the wide range of tools and libraries available for data analysis and manipulation in languages like JavaScript (which you might use with Svelte), Python, R, and others. It's a matter of identifying the appropriate techniques for your data and implementing them effectively within your app.

#### **AI Integration**;
 
 **AI Integration**: You can integrate AI into the app using its API. When users want information on trees or their benefits, they can initiate a conversation with AI within the app. AI can then provide relevant information based on the user's queries.
 **Data Collection and Analysis**: AI can access a wide range of internet sources to gather information on different tree species, their environmental benefits, economic impacts, social implications, and health benefits. It can analyze this data to provide insightful responses tailored to the user's needs.
**Statistical Information**: AI can leverage its natural language processing capabilities to extract statistical information from various sources. It can provide statistics on factors such as the carbon sequestration capacity of different tree species, their impact on property values, energy savings from shade, water conservation benefits, and more.
**Customized Responses**: AI can generate customized responses based on the specific criteria and preferences provided by the user. For example, users can specify their location, desired tree species, environmental conditions, and other parameters to receive personalized recommendations.
 **Interactive Features**: To enhance user engagement, you can incorporate interactive features into the chat interface. Users can ask questions, explore different scenarios, and receive real-time feedback from AI.
 **Continuous Learning**: AI can continually learn and improve its responses based on user interactions and feedback. This iterative process ensures that the information provided remains relevant and accurate over time.
**Tree Identification**: After the tree is planted, users can use the TreeCycle app to take a picture of the tree if they're unsure of its species. The app can then use image recognition technology to identify the tree species.
Statistical Research: If the app cannot identify the tree species from the picture, it can initiate a conversation with ChatGPT to gather information. ChatGPT can search for relevant studies, data, and statistics on the tree species from reputable sources like .edu and .org websites.
**Determining Potential Value**: ChatGPT can analyze the gathered data to determine the potential value of the tree's rootstock token. This could include assessing the tree's environmental benefits, economic impact, social value, health benefits, long-term value, cost of maintenance, community engagement opportunities, and future considerations.
**Data Compilation**: The TreeCycle app can compile the gathered data into a comprehensive report or summary for the user. This report can include information about the tree species, its benefits, potential value as a rootstock token, and any other relevant details.
**Long-Term Learning**: As users continue to plant trees and use the app, it can accumulate data and insights over time. This long-term learning process can help improve the accuracy and relevance of the information provided by the app, enhancing the user experience and decision-making capabilities.

Overall, integrating AI into the Tree Cycle app can enrich the user experience by providing valuable insights and facilitating informed decision-making when it comes to tree planting and environmental stewardship.                                                  
I was thinking of using AI's abilities to research statistics on the trees being planted. The TreeCycle App would talk to you, after the tree is planted you would use the picture to help identify the tree if the planter cannot then you would find all the .edu .org studies and data on the tree to determine the "Potential Value" of this Rootstock token. Then Tree Cycle app would compile this data so that the information gathered doesn't take the same computing power as the first time this will also allow for long term learning. 
By leveraging AI's abilities to research statistics and gather data, the TreeCycle app can empower users to make informed decisions about tree planting and contribute to environmental sustainability efforts. It also facilitates ongoing learning and improvement, ensuring that the app remains valuable and effective over time.
Taking the time to develop the TreeCycle app thoroughly will not only ensure its quality but also allow AI technology to advance and potentially address any existing issues or limitations. AI technologies like ChatGPT are continuously evolving and improving, with researchers and developers working to enhance their capabilities, address challenges, and optimize their performance
So, taking the time to develop the app thoughtfully while keeping an eye on advancements in AI technology can result in a more robust and innovative product in the end. It's an exciting time to be leveraging AI to create impactful solutions like the TreeCycle app.

### **VALUE SYSTEM**
**Carbon Credits**: You mentioned this already, but it's worth emphasizing. Rootstock tokens could be linked to carbon sequestration, with each token representing a certain amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the tree it's associated with. These tokens could be traded on carbon credit markets, where companies or individuals buy and sell credits to offset their carbon emissions. The value of Rootstock tokens would then be determined by the current market price of carbon credits.
**Ecosystem Services**: Rootstock tokens could represent not just carbon sequestration but also other ecosystem services provided by trees, such as air purification, water regulation, biodiversity support, and soil conservation. These services have tangible economic value, and the tokens could be traded based on the overall ecological benefits provided by the tree.
**Futures Trading**: You mentioned the possibility of futures trading. This could involve speculating on the future value of Rootstock tokens based on factors such as the growth rate of the tree, changes in environmental conditions, and the evolving market demand for ecosystem services. Futures trading could add liquidity to the market and allow investors to hedge against risks associated with tree planting.
**Partnerships and Benefits**: Beyond trading, holders of Rootstock tokens could receive tangible benefits or incentives. These could include discounts on eco-friendly products, access to exclusive events or workshops on sustainability, priority access to environmental initiatives or projects, or even financial rewards based on the performance of the trees associated with their tokens.
**Blockchain Integration**: By leveraging blockchain technology, you can ensure transparency and traceability in the trading of Rootstock tokens. Smart contracts could be used to automate transactions and ensure that token holders receive their entitled benefits or rewards automatically.
**Community Engagement**: The value of Rootstock tokens could also be tied to community engagement and social impact. For example, token holders could earn rewards or bonuses for actively participating in tree planting initiatives, educating others about environmental conservation, or contributing to the maintenance and monitoring of planted trees.
**Educational Programs**: Another way to add value to Rootstock tokens is through educational programs or initiatives funded by token trading revenues. This could involve sponsoring environmental education programs in schools, funding research on tree planting techniques or ecosystem services, or supporting community-based conservation projects.
Overall, the key to giving Rootstock tokens real value lies in their ability to represent tangible environmental benefits, coupled with mechanisms for trading, incentivization, and community engagement. By integrating these elements thoughtfully, you can create a currency that not only fosters environmental stewardship but also provides meaningful rewards and incentives for its holders.
[This is still being discussed because the Value of the Token on the Blockchain is yet to be determined. I would like there to be a way that Users can make real money or trade for other E-currencies because otherwise the system has to be closed with the Value only relevent in the app which eliminates the need for this to be tied to the Blockchain.]
